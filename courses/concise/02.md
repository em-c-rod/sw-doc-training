Words are the building blocks of writing. Chose them intentionally to keep readers engaged and understanding the content!

::: note Choosing words intentionally seems intimidating! Where do I start?
Thinking about intentional word choice can seem intimidating. Remember the lesson from [the overview section](../SoftwareDocumentation/03.md) that the most important first step to writing is to get SOMETHING written down. The first draft can be messy, and then you can edit the existing ideas to chose intentional, concise, words and communicate most effectively.
:::

## 1. Choose concise words

Use the shortest form of the word. For example, use the word "use" instead of "utilize" or "concept" instead of "conception of". This helps to maintain direct, concise, and better understood language.

When considering this list, understand that the "wordy phrases" can be appropriate word choices in many contexts, but practice simplifying the word choice for circumstances when doing so may make the content better understood by the reader.

## 2. Choose meaningful words

::: info A teacher once told a classroom that with the plethora of words that exist in the dictionary, there is no need to use the word "very." 
:::

### 2.1 Sample Adjectives and Adverbs
When choosing words, use words with meaning. Reduce adjectives and adverbs to promote clear, formal writing. Note the difference here:

| With Adverbs | Without Adverbs |
| - | - |
| The function **clearly** returns the sum of two numbers. | The function returns the sum of two numbers. |
| Run the help command, then input the command line flags **carefully**. |  Run the help command, then input the command line flags. |

| With Adjectives | Without Adjectives |
| - | - |
| The command line tool's **current** flags are `--help`, `--input` and `--output`.  | The command line tool's flags are `--help`, `--input` and `--output`. |
| For **detailed** instructions on installing the software, click the link below. | For information on installing the software, click the link below. |

::: danger Avoid Relative Time Phrases
You may know when you wrote or published content, but you do not know when the reader is reading it. Therefore, using phrases like "currently", "now", "at the moment", "in the future", "last month", "next year", or "later" are arbitrary. Skip these words for more concise writing. If necessary, use absolute, rather than relative time stamps, for example, "in version 3.2", "before May 2023", or "in 2024".
:::

::: info Don't stop there! - Further improvement
Even the example improvement can be improved! However, it is important to think of the purpose and audience of the writing when making these choices. Sometimes these may be more concise or direct ways of writing, but not appropriate, for example, to use in a marketing pitch where the purpose is to advertise to readers.

Example Sentence 1 - Another Option: 
**The system is designed to handle up to 1 GB of data.**
This example replaces the subjective adjective "large" with an objective amount.

Example Sentence 2 - Another Option:
**The software is equipped with a search function that can search 1 GB of data in less than 5 seconds.**
This example is longer than the first, but provides real and concrete evidence rather than subjective measurements.

Example Sentence 3 - Another Option:
**The software provides a solution for all your business needs.**
In addition to removing "truly", we can also remove "comprehensive".

Example Sentence 4 - Another Option:
**The application runs two times faster on version 3.X of the operating system.**
Make this sentence better by using valuable adjectives and adverbs like "two times faster" and "version 3.X" rather than "significantly faster" and "latest version".

## 3. Choose understandable words

Consider your audience when selecting words. Avoid or define words that are specific, technical, or outside of the average reader's vocabulary. For guidance on defining words, reference [the "Be Complete" section](../complete/).

Ask someone else to review your writing. If there are words the reader does not understand, use tools like thesaurus.com to identify synonyms that may make your word choice simpler, more concise, more understandable, or more intentional.
