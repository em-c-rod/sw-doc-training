Words are the building blocks of writing. Chose them intentionally to keep readers engaged and understanding the content!

::: note Choosing words intentionally seems intimidating! Where do I start?
Thinking about intentional word choice can seem intimidating. Remember the lesson from [the overview section](../SoftwareDocumentation/03.md) that the most important first step to writing is to get SOMETHING written down. The first draft can be messy, and then you can edit the existing ideas to chose intentional, concise, words and communicate most effectively.
:::

## 1. Choose concise words

Use the shortest form of the word. For example, use the word "use" instead of "utilize" or "concept" instead of "conception of". This helps to maintain direct, concise, and better understood language.

## 2. Choose meaningful words

::: info A teacher once told a classroom that with the plethora of words that exist in the dictionary, there is no need to use the word "very." 
:::

When choosing words, use words with meaning. Reduce adjectives and adverbs to promote clear, formal writing. Note the difference here:

| With Adverbs | Without Adverbs |
| - | - |
| The function **clearly** returns the sum of two numbers. | The function returns the sum of two numbers. |
| Run the help command, then input the command line flags **carefully**. |  Run the help command, then input the command line flags. |

| With Adjectives | Without Adjectives |
| - | - |
| The function  | No adjective use |

## 3. Avoid pronouns




## 4. Choose understandable words






Think about what is understood and obvious and what is not. Ex: Add function - the name may express the functionality, but what if it returns a ceiling? Note that.
