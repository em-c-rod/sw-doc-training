## 1. First, write something down

This section encourages engineers to get their thoughts down, however messy, because for many, deleting words is easier than creating them. Start with a stream of conscienceness, bullet points, or any way that gets the ideas written down.

## 2. Then, delete words

Once the thoughts are there, remove redundancy and reword thoughts to keep the writing short, concise, and clear.

## 3. Organize in chunks

Review the writing to make sentences short and paragraphs short.
