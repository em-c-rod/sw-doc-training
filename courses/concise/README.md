## 1 Less is More

Often, when we eliminate words, the result is more powerful and understandable. Additionally, words are the building blocks of all writing. Use words intentionally to convey the best meaning. Learn how to write concisely with intentional word choice in this section.

::: tip Practice as you learn. 
Take a moment to gather an example writing sample, whether a README, code comment, email, or anything else that you can use to gauge your current style and practice improving. If you cannot find a piece of your own writing, consider using a piece of open source software documentation.

## 2 Warm Up Example
Try it out! Which of the following are examples of concise language?

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab A

```sh
The application programming language is really a 
dynamically typed language.
```
@tab B
```sh
Python is written to be a dynamically typed 
language.
```
@tab C
```sh
The programming language is a dynamically 
typed language.
```

::: details What we think

Each of the statements have something that could be more concise. 
- Statement A uses redundant words like "application" and "really". 
- Statement B uses passive voice by saying "is written to be" instead of using active voice which is more direct and concise.
- Statement C is a concise option, but could be made more concise by using the name of the programming language, such as: "Python is a dynamically typed language."
