## 2 How to Write in Active Voice

### 2.1 Identify the Subject and Verb 
The subject of the sentence should be the one performing the action (verb). If the subject is the receiver of the action, the sentence is likely in passive voice. 

### 2.2 Use Direct Language
Active voice uses direct language, which can make your writing clearer and more concise. Instead of saying `The function was implemented by the programmer,` say `The programmer implemented the function.`

### 2.3 Rephrase Sentences
If you find you've written a sentence in the passive voice, try to rephrase it. For example, `The code was reviewed by the team` can be rephrased to `The team reviewed the code.`

### 2.4 Avoid "by" Phrases
Passive voice often includes phrases that start with `by.` If you see this in your writing, it might be a sign that you're using passive voice.

In the example: `The server was rebooted by the system administrator.`, the sentence is written in passive voice and could be rewritten to `The system administrator rebooted the server.`

### 2.5 Use Active Voice in Software Instructions
When writing instructions or procedures, use the active voice to directly address the reader. For example, instead of writing `The file should be saved,` write `Save the file.`

### 2.6 Use a Passive Voice Checker
There are online tools and features in word processing software that can help identify passive voice in your writing. Use these tools to help you spot and correct passive sentences.

::: info Should I always use active voice?
Remember, while it's generally recommended to use active voice in technical writing, there are instances where passive voice may be necessary or even preferred, such as when the focus is on the action being done rather than who is doing it.

## 3 Choose active verbs

::: note Present Perfect Tense

In addition to active vs. passive voice, take inventory of your present perfect tense usage for more direct communication. When you find phrases with _have + past participle of verb_ in your writing, that is a sign that you may need more concise language.

[British council](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/english-grammar-reference/present-perfect) states that present perfect tense describes "something that started in the past and continues in the present." _Have + past particible of verb_ forms the present perfect tense. For example: 
- I have been to that restaurant.
- I have played saxophone for 15 years.

When used in software documentation, consider replacing present perfect tense with past or present simple tense or choosing a more active verb to make the sentence more direct and understandable.

For example:

| Present Perfect | Better Option |
| ---- | ---- |
| This application has been developed to do X.  | This application does X. |
