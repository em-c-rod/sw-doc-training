## 2. Choose meaningful words

When choosing words, use words with meaning. Reduce adjectives and adverbs to promote clear, formal writing. Note the difference here:

| With Adverbs | Without Adverbs |
| - | - |
| The function **clearly** returns the sum of two numbers. | The function returns the sum of two numbers. |
| Run the help command, then input the command line flags **carefully**. |  Run the help command, then input the command line flags. |

| With Adjectives | Without Adjectives |
| - | - |
| The function  | No adjective use |

## 3. Avoid pronouns




## 4. Choose understandable words






Think about what is understood and obvious and what is not. Ex: Add function - the name may express the functionality, but what if it returns a ceiling? Note that.
