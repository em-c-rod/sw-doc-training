## 2.1 Active vs. Passive Voice

Can you tell which statements use active voice and which statements use passive voice?

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab A

```sh

```
@tab B
```sh
Python is written to be a dynamically typed 
language.
```
@tab C
```sh
The programming language is a dynamically 
typed language.
```

::: details What we think

Each of the statements have something that could be more concise. 
- Statement A uses redundant words like "application" and "really". 
- Statement B uses passive voice by saying "is written to be" instead of using active voice which is more direct and concise.
- Statement C is a concise option, but could be made more concise by using the name of the programming language, such as: "Python is a dynamically typed language."

## 2.2 Start with the subject

## 2.3 Choose active verbs

::: note Present Perfect Tense

In addition to active vs. passive voice, take inventory of your present perfect tense usage for more direct communication. When you find phrases with _have + past participle of verb_ in your writing, that is a sign that you may need more concise language.

[British council](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/english-grammar-reference/present-perfect) states that present perfect tense describes "something that started in the past and continues in the present." _Have + past particible of verb_ forms the present perfect tense. For example: 
- I have been to that restaurant.
- I have played saxophone for 15 years.

When used in software documentation, consider replacing present perfect tense with past or present simple tense or choosing a more active verb to make the sentence more direct and understandable.

For example:

| Present Perfect | Better Option |
| ---- | ---- |
| This application has been developed to do X.  | This application does X. |
