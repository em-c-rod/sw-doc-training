## 1.1 What is Software Documentation?
Whether to understand existing legacy code, develop software on a team, work
in the growing amount of open-source software, or create a robust software
system that can be used by others over time, software documentation is a key
artifact for software use, maintenance, and evolution (Smith et al., 2014).
Although there may be various definitions in practice, Sumita, Luer, and
Seaman define software documentation as “anything written down about a
software system, including source code, communications, reports, and notes, as
well as formal documentation” (2007). Although modern software engineering
practices like Agile Development suggest valuing working code over
documentation, empirical data has shown that this value does not mean
documentation is obsolete and suggests that documentation is still important and
necessary (Steina & Heijstek, 2011). Despite its importance, software engineers
in the workplace are not equipped to write effective software documentation.

## 1.2 What can you learn here?
The purpose of this content is to serve as a reference to teach and guide professional software engineers on how to create effective software documentation. The content can be done its entirety, at which point, you should accomplish the following objectives:
- Understand the attributes of effective software documentation
- Identify and explain ineffective software documentation in real world
examples
- Generate effective software documentation given a real world scenario
- Summarize and define technical concepts to an audience which includes
non technical backgrounds
- Describe the big picture context of a particular technical solution

Feel free to also peruse and reference this content for the sections that are most relevant in particular situations.
