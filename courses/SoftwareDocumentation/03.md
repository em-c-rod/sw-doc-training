## 3. Measuring Effective Documentation

Several case studies have remarked on the value and need for effective software
documentation, including a study which clearly defined the aributes most
useful in successful software engineering. Valued aspects of documentation from
the participants were accuracy, simplicity, readability, completeness, brevity, and
a need for a high-level view (Sumita et al., 2007)

We will take these values and break them down in sections to learn more. Feel free to 
learn from the sections in the order that works for you, and practice your skills at the 
end of each section and at combine all skills for a final, cummulative practice.

The sections are:
- [Be Concise](../concise/README.md)
- [Be Complete]((../complete/README.md))
- [Be Accurate]((../accurate/README.md))
- [Be Big Picture]((../big-picture/README.md))
