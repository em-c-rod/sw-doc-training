## 1 What is the Scope?
Depending on the type of documentation you are writing and the type of audience that will read it, your scope may look very different. For example, a comment in the code will have a limited audience, probably only to include developers, and a limited scope, probably only to include one or a few lines of code to describe. However, an application README file may have a diverse audience including software developers, testers, application users, and more. The scope may include application description, installation instructions, features, example usage, and even perhaps documentation for development and code contributions.

## 2 How Can I Identify the Scope?

## 3 Put it in Practice!

Think about what is understood and obvious and what is not. Ex: Add function - the name may express the functionality, but what if it returns a ceiling? Note that.

Define the problem and establish the objective.
These are your boundaries. Stay within these boundaries.

Describe the necessary steps from start to end required to achieve the objective.

There are bodies that give standards and examples - IEEE, etc.
