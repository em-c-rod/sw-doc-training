## 1 What Does Be Big Picture Mean?
One of the valued attributes of software documentation was having a big-picture view. This is very easy to overlook as there are many instances where participants of a software team may not even know the big picture themselves. It is possible to scope a task or ticket such that the developer requires curiousity to learn why they are doing that task. The reader of documentation will be more motivated and understand the content better if they understnad that big picture and see the "why" of what they are reading.

## 2 Warm Up Example
Try it out! Consider someone asking you to get dressed to go to an event that for which they will pick you up in one hour. You receive the instructions:

1. Put on pants
2. Put on a shirt
3. Put on socks
4. Put on shoes
5. Be ready to leave in one hour.

These are detailed instructions that break down the idea of getting dressed, but what kind of challenges would you have with these instructions?

::: details What we think
After reading these instructions, there is no understanding of the purpose of these instructions, or the big picture view. Where are we going? What is the event? Will it be inside or outside? The attire for a soccer game, for example, would be much different than the attire for a nice dinner. It is important to understand the big picture so the reader can respond to the documentation accordingly.
