Think about what is understood and obvious and what is not. Ex: Add function - the name may express the functionality, but what if it returns a ceiling? Note that.

Define the problem and establish the objective.
These are your boundaries. Stay within these boundaries.

At a minimum, you need:
1. an overview system architecture (OV1)
2. a diagram of the dataflow (context diagram)

If your application uses business logic or third party code, create an archimate diagram.
