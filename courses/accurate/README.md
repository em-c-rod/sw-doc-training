## Why is accuracy important?

Consistency is accuracy. Accuracy is quality and credibility. 

::: tip
Consider code standards for how you document your code. Do all functions have a given header, etc.?

Accuracy is important to communicate effectively and to establish credibility. California State University explains "inconsistencies in technical writing will confuse your readers and convince them that your scientific work and reasoning are as sloppy and unorganized as your prose."

3. Use correct terms to convey technical information

Define terms for varying audiences

## 1. Test your documentation

Whether for readability, grammar, or accuracte instructions, reviewing, reading, and testing the documentation by putting yourself in the shoes of the typical reader, you may find inaccuracies. 

### Example
"Despite the the fact that the software update was supposed to improve functionality, many users reported experiencing glitches."

::: note Check your work
Online tools exist that can identify words used more than once. For example, [this online text tool](https://onlinetexttools.com/find-duplicate-text-words) is one of many ways you can test your own documentation to start to find duplicate words - whether simply repeated as errors or whether to make your documentation simpler as discussed in [the Be Concise section](../concise/03.md). You could even write your own software script to help you with your documentation!
