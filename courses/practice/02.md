## Example 4 Discussion

The example of poor documentation demonstrated the following issues:


1. Redundancies: The same information is repeated multiple times, such as "install the software" and "use the software."
2. Poor Word Choice: The language is repetitive and lacks variety, which can make the text boring and hard to follow.
3. Lack of Definition for Technical Words: Terms like ".exe file," "API," and "GET method" are used without being defined, which can confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms.
4. Incorrect Grammar: The text contains several grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb tenses and awkward sentence structures.
5. Lack of Context: The text doesn't provide any context about what the software does, why the reader would want to install it, or how the API and GET method are used in the software. This makes it hard for the reader to understand the purpose of the instructions.
