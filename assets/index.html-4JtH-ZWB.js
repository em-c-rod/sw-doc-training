Although modern software engineering<br> practices like Agile Development suggest valuing working code over<br> documentation, empirical data has shown that this value does not mean<br> documentation is obsolete and suggests that documentation is still important and<br> necessary (Steina &amp; Heijstek, 2011). Despite its importance, software engineers<br> in the workplace are not equipped to write effective software documentation.</p><h2 id="_1-2-what-can-you-learn-here" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-what-can-you-learn-here" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.2 What can you learn here?</h2><p>The purpose of this content is to serve as a reference to teach and guide professional software engineers on how to create effective software documentation.
