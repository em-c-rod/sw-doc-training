For example, a comment in the code will have a limited audience, probably only to include developers, and a limited scope, probably only to include one or a few lines of code to describe. However, an application README file may have a diverse audience including software developers, testers, application users, and more. The scope may include application description, installation instructions, features, example usage, and even perhaps documentation for development and code contributions.</p><h2 id="_2-how-can-i-identify-the-scope" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-how-can-i-identify-the-scope" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2 How Can I Identify the Scope?</h2><h3 id="_2-1-identify-the-who" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-identify-the-who" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.1 Identify the &quot;Who&quot;</h3><p>Identify the audience of the software documentation.
