This can happen because the writer may be much more familiar with the process than the reader and forget to include things that are common knowledge to the writer and not the reader. For example, a software developer of an application may be intimately aware of how to use an application given that he or she may have been involved in the requirements, development, and testing. This may lead the developer to skip steps when writing documentation for readers from a different background.",-1),m={class:"hint-container tip"},w=e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Test Your Documentation",-1),b=c(`<h2 id="_2-how-to-not-skip-steps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-how-to-not-skip-steps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2 How to Not Skip Steps</h2><h3 id="_2-1-write-while-you-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-write-while-you-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.1 Write while you do</h3><p>One way to not skip steps is to write the instructions as you do them, stopping after every instruction to record the necessary information in documentation. Remember to include output or results to actions when possible. For example, after running the <code>docker ps</code> command, you should see two containers running:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
c114494b9812   redhat/ubi8    <span class="token string">&quot;/bin/bash&quot;</span>              <span class="token number">38</span> minutes ago   Up <span class="token number">38</span> minutes             redhat8
944568b8768c   nginx:latest   <span class="token string">&quot;/docker-entrypoint.â€¦&quot;</span>   <span class="token number">38</span> minutes ago   Up <span class="token number">38</span> minutes   <span class="token number">80</span>/tcp    nginx
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="_2-2-include-the-unhappy-path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-include-the-unhappy-path" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.2 Include the &quot;unhappy path&quot;</h3><p>Many people refer to the &quot;happy path&quot; as the steps, process, or sequence that occurs with no errors. For example, when describing login instructions to a website, you may tell the user to navigate to a particular link, enter their username, enter their password, and click &quot;Login&quot; to enter the website and accomplish the next step. This is the &quot;happy path&quot; where nothing went wrong. However, what happens if that user forgets their password, or enters an incorrect username? What happens if the user tried to sign in but has never created an account on the website? It is important to create documentation steps that address errors or sequences outside the &quot;happy path&quot;.</p><p>Another example is if I run <code>docker ps</code> and instead of seeing two running docker containers, I see:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the <span class="token function">docker</span> daemon running?
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The writer may not have run into this path, but making sure the docker daemon is running before being able to run a docker command is theoretically a necessary step. However, it is a step that may not appear for the writer because they may use docker often and already have it running. Whereas a reader may be doing this for the first time and run into this problem without context of what is happening or what to do about it. Including information about these possible results can help readers complete the steps effectively and independently, especially when they run into issues.</p><h3 id="_2-3-link-to-extra-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-link-to-extra-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.3 Link to extra information</h3><p>There may be a variety in your documentation target audience background. Link to other areas, whether written by you or others, to explain steps that most may know but a few may need more information about. For example, when writing instructions on how to build this training content locally, I included links to GitHub&#39;s documentation about how to clone a repository after instructing users to clone the repository, I did not need to reinvent what GitHub wrote, nor did I need to include that for all users, but linking to it gave the option.</p>`,11),g={href:"https://github.com/em-c-rod/sw-doc-training/wiki/How-to-Run-the-Application",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=e("h2",{id:"_3-put-it-in-practice",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#_3-put-it-in-practice","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" 3 Put it in Practice!")],-1),y=e("p",null,"Rather than a software example, consider a common task you do without thinking, like brushing your teeth.
