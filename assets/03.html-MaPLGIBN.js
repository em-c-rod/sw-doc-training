Remember that many software platforms do not have the built-in grammar checking that text editors do, therefore, making grammar mistakes can be easy to do.</p><p>A full course on English grammar is beyong the scope of this training content, but we at least want to provide some common considerations and resources for your reference.</p><h2 id="_2-common-grammar-considerations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-common-grammar-considerations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2 Common Grammar Considerations</h2><h3 id="_2-1-subject-verb-agreement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-subject-verb-agreement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.1 Subject-Verb Agreement</h3><p>The subject of a sentence doesn&#39;t agree in number with its verb.

For example, &quot;After reviewing the code, the bugs were easy to find&quot; implies that the bugs reviewed the code. A better sentence would be &quot;After reviewing the code, we found the bugs easily.&quot;</p><h3 id="_2-4-run-on-sentences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-4-run-on-sentences" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.4 Run-On Sentences</h3><p>These can make your writing hard to follow.

It now includes new features.&quot;</p><h3 id="_2-5-incorrect-use-of-commas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-incorrect-use-of-commas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.5 Incorrect Use of Commas</h3><p>Commas can change the meaning of a sentence if used incorrectly.
