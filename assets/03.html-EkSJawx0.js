Statement C and D uses active voice! Think about which sentences sound more direct and concise.</p></details><p>Using active voice rather than passive voice can make writing more direct and concise. Active voice eliminates the need for some prepositional phrases, removes extra wording for passive voice verb conjugations, and gives the reader a quicker understanding of the concept because of the direct language.</p><h2 id="_2-how-to-write-in-active-voice" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-how-to-write-in-active-voice" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2 How to Write in Active Voice</h2><h3 id="_2-1-identify-the-subject-and-verb" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-identify-the-subject-and-verb" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.1 Identify the Subject and Verb</h3><p>The subject of the sentence should be the one performing the action (verb).
